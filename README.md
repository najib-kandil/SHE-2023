This simulation reconstructs the framework introduced in On a Networked SIS Epidemic Model with Cooperative and Antagonistic Opinion Dynamics (she2023)
In understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases, the interplay between 
epidemiological factors and public perception has emerged as a critical area of study. 
This simulation examines the coupled dynamics of epidemic spreading and opinion formation
within networked communities, as explored through the mathematical model presented in 
the article "On a Networked SIS Epidemic Model with Cooperative and Antagonistic Opinion
Dynamics." By integrating the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic framework
with an opinion dynamics model that incorporates both cooperative and antagonistic
interactions, the study provides insights into how public beliefs about disease severity
influence, and are influenced by, the trajectory of an outbreak. 
The model introduces an innovative concept of an opinion-dependent reproduction number, 
characterizing the mutual influence between disease spread and opinion dissemination.
This simulation delves into the implications of these findings for epidemic control, 
particularly in leveraging social dynamics to suppress outbreaks effectively.
